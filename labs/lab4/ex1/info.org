* What does WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA), and why is it important for scanning?

The Arduino command $\text{WiFi.mode(WIFI\_STA)}$ sets the Wi-Fi module (like on an ESP8266 or ESP32) into **Station Mode** (STA mode), which is essential for scanning networks.

** What $\text{WiFi.mode(WIFI\_STA)}$ Does

$\text{WiFi.mode(WIFI\_STA)}$ configures your Wi-Fi device to act as a **Station** or a **Client**.

Station (STA) Mode:** In this mode, the device behaves like a typical Wi-Fi-enabled device (like a smartphone or laptop) that connects to an existing **Access Point (AP)**, such as your home router. It allows the device to:
 Search for available Wi-Fi networks (scanning).
 Connect to a specific Wi-Fi network.
 Send and receive data over that network.

The opposite of $\text{WIFI\_STA}$ is $\text{WIFI\_AP}$ (Access Point mode), where the device *creates* its own Wi-Fi network for other devices to connect to. You can also use $\text{WIFI\_AP\_STA}$ to run both modes simultaneously.

** Importance for Scanning

Setting the mode to $\text{WIFI\_STA}$ is typically **required** before running the $\text{WiFi.scanNetworks()}$ function, because:

1.  **Enables the Radio:** Setting the Wi-Fi mode explicitly turns on the Wi-Fi radio hardware, preparing it for network operations.
2.  **Defines the Role:** For a device to search for existing networks (SSIDs, signal strength, etc.), it must be configured to act as a **client** that is looking to connect. This is the fundamental role of **Station Mode**.
3.  **Correct Initialization:** While some $\text{WiFi}$ libraries might implicitly switch to $\text{WIFI\_STA}$ when you call $\text{WiFi.begin()}$ or $\text{WiFi.scanNetworks()}$, it's considered **best practice** to explicitly set the mode first. This ensures the Wi-Fi stack is correctly initialized for the intended operation, especially if the module was previously in a different mode ($\text{WIFI\_AP}$ or off).

In summary, you set the device to $\text{WIFI\_STA}$ to tell it: "Start up the Wi-Fi radio and prepare to act as a client looking for a network," which is the necessary prerequisite for the $\text{WiFi.scanNetworks()}$ function to do its job.


* How can you tell if a network is open or secured from the output?
 In the example given, if no encription type is displayed, it means that the network is
 publicly open

* What does a more negative RSSI value (like -80 dBm) mean about the signal?
The signal is pretty much dead
